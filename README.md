A project i worked on over the course of a few months first for fun then for a game jam. I initially coded it as a single player game as i didn't know how to do multiplayer but then for the game jam i decided to almost fully rewrite it as a multiplayer game after seeing how fun the original was to play.

You can find the working build in GrappleBall-Working/MainBuild
