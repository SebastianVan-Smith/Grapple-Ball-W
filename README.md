A project I worked on over the course of half a year on/off  first for fun, then later for a game jam. 
It was made in Unity 3D with custom player controllers and pretty much everything else, aside from the physics and Mirror.

I initially coded it as a single player game as i didn't know how to do multiplayer but then for the game jam I decided to almost fully rewrite it as a multiplayer game after seeing how fun the original was to play.

It uses Mirror for networking, it did have a custom lobby system at one point but then i realised it was better to use the built in one.
I didn't have enough time to impliment it fully which is why the lobby system is a bit barebones.

In order to play multiplyer over the internet you have to forward port 7777 but it works fine on local networks.

You can find the working build in GrappleBall-Working/MainBuild
